# SecureNoise-Key-Generation-Algorithm
The SecureNoise Key Generation Algorithm is a novel approach to creating cryptographic keys using noise. This algorithm enhances the security of key generation by introducing randomness from a noise source, making it harder for adversaries to predict or brute-force the keys.
